- `CongeladoPorAgua`: This class inherits from `ProductoCongelado` and represents products frozen by water. It adds `salinidadAguaCongelacion` attribute.

- `CongeladoPorNitrogeno`: This class inherits from `ProductoCongelado` and represents products frozen by nitrogen. It adds `metodoCongelacion` and `tiempoExposicionNitr√≥geno` attributes.

- `Principal`: This class contains the `main` method where instances of the above classes are created and their information is displayed.
